1. Make a low-pass box filter with shared memory
    -How much data did you put in shared memory?
        The part of the image that is "covered" by each block + enough padding to not read garbage while blurring.

    -How much data does each thread copy to shared memory?
        Each thread copies 2xbiggestkernelsize to shared memory, so a 5x5 kernel means each thread copies 10 pixels and a 5x2 kernel also copies 10 pixels

    -How did you handle the necessary overlap between the blocks?
        Each block simply read data outside the boundaries. This leads to neighbouring blocks reading some of the same data however.

    -If we would like to increase the block size, about how big blocks would be safe to use in this case? Why?
        We compute one pixel per thread in each block meaning that we cannot compute more then 1024 pixels per block meaning that the maximum safe size is 32x32

    -How much speedup did you get over the naive version? For what filter size?
        Bad kernel time: 673108 ms
        Good kernel time: 3045 ms
        35x35 kernel

    -Is your access to global memory coalesced? What should you do to get that?
        No, since we're reading in a cross-pattern and thus traversing memory on more than one "axis". We will thus not read the memory in sequence. 

2.
    -How much speedup did you get over the non-separated? For what filter size?
        Bad kernel time: 834404 ms (Original)
        Good kernel time: 11078 ms (Non-separable)
        Best kernel time: 6314 ms (Separable)

3.
    -Compare the visual result to that of the box filter. Is the image LP-filtered with the weighted kernel noticeably better?
        - The result produced by the gaussian kernel is noticeably clearer 

    -What was the difference in time to a box filter of the same size (5x5)?
        - They vary slightly around eachother but are comparable in speed

    -If you want to make a weighted kernel customizable by weights from the host, how would you deliver the weights to the GPU?
        - Using cudaMemcpy from the host to upload the weights (kernel argument)

4.
    -What kind of algorithm did you implement for finding the median?
        Good old bubble sort

    -What filter size was best for reducing noise?
        7x7 or 9x9 seems like the best compromise of not too much blur and decent noise removal
