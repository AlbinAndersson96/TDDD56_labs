Write a detailed explanation why computation load can be imbalanced and how it affects the global performance?
- The iterative loop detects if our calculations are diverging and exits early meaning that if the calculation does not diverge it will
  take longer to compute and thus create an in-balance in computation load.

Describe different load-balancing methods that would help reducing the performanceloss due to load-imbalance. You should be able to come up with at least two.
- Static load balancing
    * A solution that is derived before runtime such that there will be no extra runtime overhead and all rules are pre-defined.
    * In the case of mandelbrot we can make the threads calculate sections of N size where N is the number of threads and iterative over the entire image
      and thus it should roughly equalize the load on all threads
- Dynamic load balancing
    * A solution that during runtime adapts and shifts loads according to which threads are doing a lot of work and some whom are not.
    * A way of dynamically allocating work would be for the threads to have a shared work pool to pull tasks from, not stopping execution until the pool is empty and all work is done.
